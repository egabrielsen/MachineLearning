       "['Officials with Volkswagen-First Automotive Works in northeastern China on Monday dismissed a report that the joint venture faced possible closure.\\n\"This report is incorrect,\" said a spokeswoman of the joint venture, referring to a report by the German news magazine Der Spiegel.\\n\"Production is still continuing,\" she said in a telephone interview from Changchun.\\n\"We have a 25-year agreement. If the German side withdrew unilaterally, they would have to pay compensation,\" she said. She added that the two sides would soon hold a ceremony marking the full implementation of the joint venture project.\\nA spokesman for Volkswagen AG\\'s Volkswagen Asia-Pacific arm in Hong Kong also said production at the joint venture would continue.\\n\"There is no reason to leave Changchun,\" he said.\\nDer Spiegel said the Changchun plant was losing money and production of the Jetta car had practically ceased.\\nThe Hong Kong-based official said the factory had produced 14,700 Jetta cars in the first eight months of this year, up 10 percent from a year ago.\\nThe Jetta was not selling as well as the Volkswagen Santana produced at Volkswagen\\'s Shanghai joint venture, but that operation had taken the lion\\'s share of the domestic passenger car market, he said.\\nHowever, some changes in the joint venture agreement were being negotiated, including the introduction of new car models as well as the possibility of Volkswagen taking over sales and after-sales service, the official added.\\nFirst Automotive Works had been producing Audi 100s at its own production line in Changchun under a seven-year licensing agreement that expired in June. The Audi 200 was now being built at the joint venture, and 400 have been produced since June.\\nA total of 7,445 Audi 100s were built from January to June this year, the Volkswagen official said.\\nFirst Automotive has also sold 4,120 of its Red Flag cars, an Audi-based car that the Chinese company produces separately from the joint venture using a Chrysler Corp engine, according to Volkswagen.\\n',\n",
       " 'A Chinese appeals court, in a rare move, sharply reduced on Friday to five years a prison sentence for an International Monetary Fund (IMF) employee accused of corruption.\\nThe court\\'s decision followed a brief suspension of technical assistance by the IMF and a Beijing visit by IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus to voice concern over what he described as judicial shortcomings in the case.\\nThe Beijing Municipal Higher People\\'s Court sentenced Hong Yang, 44, a Chinese national, to five years in prison for accepting bribes totalling 100,000 yuan ($12,000) in 1993, before he joined the IMF, the Xinhua news agency said.\\n\"The sentence was dealt with leniently... and according to law,\" Xinhua quoting the court as saying on Friday.\\nHong, a former employee of the People\\'s Bank of China, or central bank, was arrested in December while on an IMF mission to China. He was found guilty on June 28.\\nBeijing sources said the original sentence was for 10 years, although statements by the IMF in Washington put it at 11 years.

He used LME broker credits,\" said Chang of the Shanghai trader.\\nAsked if special accounts were used to hide losses -- as in the Barings case - Chang said: \"You could say it was exactly the same.\"\\nAuditors were also unable to make sense of the trading accounts, he added.\\nBut unlike Barings, CITIC managed to survive the losses, which were about $40 million compared to Leeson\\'s, which neared $1.4 billion.\\nChang said the losses still nearly bankrupted the CITIC Shanghai operations.\\n\"We have stepped up our internal controls,\" he said, adding that other prominent cases - such as Sumitomo\\'s copper trading losses -- had been instructive in reducing future risk.\\nCITIC\\'s subsidiaries are no longer allowed to conduct operations unrelated to their core activities.\\nCITIC has also stopped all commodities trading on foreign markets, in line with a central government directive.\\nAsked if the company might return to the market, Chang said this was unlikely in the near future.\\n',\n",

It was seeking to form a joint venture with other domestic partners though this project still required regulatory approval.\\n',\n",

The move was expected to hurt revenue and has already pressured the company\\'s share price.\\nChina\\'s railways carried 448 million passengers in the first half of the year, down 14 percent from a year ago, according to official media reports.  \\nZhang said that overall China\\'s railways were profitable, although some routes were losing money. And overall, profits were not keeping up with past performances.\\n\"As of last year, we have not been doing as well,\" he said without giving any figures.\\nOverstaffing was a key problem because the railway system has 3.3 million workers on its payrolls. But shedding jobs requires tough political decisions because unemployment is seen as a source of potential social unrest.\\nGovernment control over rail rates is also a problem. The ministry would like to raise rates but has little room to do so.\\n\"This is a sensitive area,\" said Zhang.\\nThe ministry is trying to speed up its trains, increase capacity and provide more comfortable passenger cars. It plans to expand electrified rail service to 28 percent of its capacity by 2000 from 19 percent now.\\nNew plans for electric locomotive production are under discussion, and Switzerland\\'s ABB AG and Germany\\'s Siemens AG are among the top contenders.\\nDiscussions are under way with Canada\\'s Bombardier for joint production of modern passenger cars, and plans are moving ahead for a computerised, nationwide ticketing service.  \\n\"If we don\\'t compete we will lose market share,\" said Zhang.\\n(US$1 = HK$7.73)\\n',\n",

But it feared the MPT\\'s equipment-making capacity would eventually squeeze it out of the market unless it had its own captive customers.\\nThe other key partners had private telecommunications networks with spare capacity, while the MPT\\'s public network was heavily overcrowded.\\nThe feud between the rival Chinese government camps was often bitter, sometimes ensnaring foreign companies. Firms that did business with the new network were threatened with blacklisting by the MPT, according to Western industry sources.\\nThose frictions have eased somewhat in recent months, but it still took an order from the State Council, or cabinet, for promised network interconnections to emerge.\\nChina expects to have more than 60 million telephone lines installed by the end of this year -- adding a breathtaking 10 million in 1996 alone. The total is likely to top 100 million by the turn of the century, still only a small segment of the nation\\'s 1.2 billion people.\\nMPT says it should not be considered a competitor to Unicom because it has a separate operating arm called China Telecom.\\n\"Since 1993, we have separated policy making from business operations by creating China Telecom,\" said an MPT spokesman. \"The MPT is not both regulating and competing,\" he said, blaming Unicom\\'s slow progress on its own technical problems.\\nSTRUGGLE TO BE IMPARTIAL\\nBut China Telecom officials concede it is hard to say where one entity ends and the other begins.

He met President Bill Clinton on Monday last week.\\nClinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin held talks at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in the Philippines last month, and an exchange of visits by the two leaders is planned over 1997 and 1998.\\nU.S. Vice President Al Gore is expected to visit China some time during the first half of next year.\\nBut there is no talk yet of a return visit to the United States by Premier Li, Gore\\'s counterpart in the Chinese government.\\nU.S. officials in Beijing played down the lack of an invitation, saying the timing of the Gore visit itself had not been set.\\nOther foreign analysts said an invitation would be made but there was little chance of a visit before a new premier takes office in 1998.\\nChina is expected to sort out its leadership line-up at the Communist Party congress late next year and then formally install new government figures at the parliament meeting in March 1998.\\n\"They (the Americans) seem to be waiting for the selection of the next premier,\" said another foreign diplomat.\\nWestern leaders, including Americans, have been willing to meet Li in China. But for some of them, hosting him in their own country is another matter, diplomats said.\\nLi has been tarred with the decision to use military force to crush the pro-democracy protests in Beijing in 1989, though paramount leader Deng Xiaoping was the only man with sufficient clout to order in the army.\\nPresident Jiang was also elevated to his role as Communist Party chief because of his tough stance on dissent.\\nLi has not visited the United States, the United Kingdom or Australia since 1989. He has travelled to Germany, France and Canada since then, though he has been dogged by controversy on each trip.\\n',\n",

Since then many investors have remained cautious.\\n\"There were definite similarities in approach,\" said a stock market policy official who declined to be identified.\\n\"They (regulators) are looking at the same objectives -- the stock markets were too high and they hoped the markets would move lower,\" he said.\\nA spokeswoman for the China Securities Regulatory Commission chuckled over the suggestion that Greenspan might have inspired Beijing\\'s action.\\n\"Our objective was to bring some stability to the market,\" she said without elaborating.\\nWhatever the objective, many brokers and investors were not entirely sympathetic with the result.\\n\"The phrasing (of the commentary) was much too tough,\" said an angry broker in Shenzhen, home of one of the nation\\'s two officially approved stock markets.\\n\"This was over the top,\" he said.\\nThe commentary called up images of Wall Street\\'s 1929 crash while it lashed out at big investors for manipulating the market and blamed brokers for improperly extending overdrafts to finance stock purchases.\\nThe state media also came under criticism for helping to pump up the market by urging investors to buy shares.\\nLast week, the bourses in Shanghai and Shenzhen in southern China slapped curbs on share movements, limiting them to a daily 10 percent in either direction.\\nShenzhen\\'s A share market for domestic investors fell the 10 percent limit on Monday, sliding 46.34 points to 417.2 while Shanghai\\'s A share market lost 9.92 percent, or 115.37 points, to 1,047.68.\\nThe B share indices, which track shares supposedly reserved for foreign investors, closely mirrored the A share falls.\\nBoth Shenzhen and Shanghai had seen huge run-ups in share prices this year, with most of the gains made in recent months. Shenzhen had surged 360 percent from a trough to the peak this month, while Shanghai had climbed about 150 percent.\\nSome brokers were sympathetic to the plight of regulators.\\n\"The market was clearly very speculative,\" said a Beijing-based broker. \"I disagree with some people over how far ahead of itself the market actually was but there was bound to be a considerable pyschological impact from any action by the regulators.\"\\nBrokers said that part of the reason behind the steep rise was the lack of alternative investments.\\nTwo interest rate cuts this year had played a key role in luring money into the stock market.\\n',\n",

Many investors say \\'you are not big enough\\',\" he said, adding that more shares would be sold once the assets were injected into the listed vehicle.\\nThe plan requires a sharp reduction in the price-to-earnings ratio of the company\\'s stock -- now at about 23 -- to about 10.\\nDuan said a sharp rise in earnings expected this year and in 1997 would help to set the stage for the plan.\\nThe Beijing-based Stone Group Corp listed shares in 1993 with a HK$300 million ($38 million) flotation for Stone Electronic Technology Ltd.\\nThe group still has a controlling 57 percent stake in the Hong Kong company, which makes integrated word processors and printers and distributes a wide range of products, including computers as well as office and lighting equipment.\\nStone Group now has 18 joint ventures and it plans to start placing some of those assets into the listed firm.\\n\"We are preparing to inject some of the profitable companies into that vehicle,\" Duan said.\\nStone Group probably will inject a large part of its 40 percent stake in a $60 million China-based joint venture with Matsushita of Japan to produce light fixtures. The plant has required heavy start-up costs but should be profitable next year, Duan said.\\nStone Group also has a stake in a $1.6 billion semiconductor project with Mitsubishi Electric and Mitsui in China, although that will not begin production until late 1997 or early 1998.\\nStone, one of the success stories of China\\'s electronics industry, was started with a loan of 20,000 yuan ($2,400) in 1984.\\n\"We used to compete with just the little guys,\" said Duan.\\n\"That has changed dramatically in recent years,\" he said, adding that all major multi-nationals were now in the domestic market as China has relaxed its once-tight curbs on imports.\\n\"Technology is also changing rapidly so we have to make use of our capital,\" the executive said. \"We can\\'t let it stand still.\"\\nStone Electronic\\'s profits slumped to HK$17 million in 1995 from HK$63.88 million in 1994. But earnings for the first half of this year were up 44 percent over the year-ago period to HK$10.22 million.\\n\"I can\\'t give a profit figure for all of this year but the full year growth will be better than first-half growth,\" Duan said, adding that 1997 should continue that trend.\\nStone sees specialised electronic products for the banking system and tax collection as areas where it has major advantages over its competitors.\\nThe parent company has also diversified into finance, setting up securities and futures trading operations and investing in a bank. Income from financial operations already has exceeded the company\\'s electronics business. ($1= 8.3 yuan) ($1= 7.8 Hong Kong dollars)\\n',\n",

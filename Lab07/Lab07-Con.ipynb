    "# Lab Assignment Seven: Wide and Deep Network Architectures\n",
    "Erik Gabrielsen, Danh Nguyen, Conrad Appel\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will select a prediction task to perform on your dataset, evaluate two different deep learning architectures and tune hyper-parameters for each architecture. If any part of the assignment is not clear, ask the instructor to clarify. \n",
    "\n",
    "This report is worth 10% of the final grade. Please upload a report (one per team) with all code used, visualizations, and text in a rendered Jupyter notebook. Any visualizations that cannot be embedded in the notebook, please provide screenshots of the output. The results should be reproducible using your report. Please carefully describe every assumption and every step in your report.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Select a dataset identically to lab one. That is, the dataset must be table data. In terms of generalization performance, it is helpful to have a large dataset for building a wide and deep network. It is also helpful to have many different categorical features to create the embeddings and cross-product embeddings. It is fine to perform binary classification or multi-class classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grading Rubric\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preparation (40 points total)\n",
    "[10 points] Define and prepare your class variables. Use proper variable representations (int, float, one-hot, etc.). Use pre-processing methods (as needed) for dimensionality reduction, scaling, etc. Remove variables that are not needed/useful for the analysis. Describe the final dataset that is used for classification/regression (include a description of any newly formed variables you created). \n",
    "\n",
    "[10 points] Identify groups of features in your data that should be combined into cross-product features. \n",
    "\n",
    "[10 points] Choose and explain what metric(s) you will use to evaluate your algorithm’s performance. You should give a detailed argument for why this (these) metric(s) are appropriate on your data. That is, why is the metric appropriate for the task (e.g., in terms of the business case for the task). Please note: rarely is accuracy the best evaluation metric to use. Think deeply about an appropriate measure of performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "[10 points] Choose the method you will use for dividing your data into training and testing (i.e., are you using Stratified 10-fold cross validation? Shuffle splits? Why?). Explain why your chosen method is appropriate or use more than one method as appropriate. Convince me that your cross validation method is a realistic mirroring of how an algorithm would be used in practice. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Modeling (50 points total)\n",
    "[20 points] Create a combined wide and deep network to classify your data using tensorflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "[20 points] Investigate generalization performance by altering the number of layers. Try at least two different deep network architectures. Use the method of cross validation and evaluation metric that you argued for at the beginning of the lab. \n",
    "\n",
    "[10 points] Compare the performance of your best wide and deep network to a standard multi-layer perceptron (MLP) using the receiver operating characteristic and area under the curve.   \n",
    "\n",
    "### Exceptional Work (10 points total)\n",
    "You have free reign to provide additional analyses.\n",
    "One idea: Investigate which cross-product features are most important and hypothesize why."

    "## Bank Marketing Data Set\n",
    "\n",
    "For our data set we chose to use the bank marketing data set from a Portuguese banking institute. This data was collected and used to determine whether or not a client will subscribe to a term deposite based on demographical and other information of the call recipient. The training data set has 45211 number of instances, and there are 20 attributes associated with each instance. The following are the columns listed in order. The last column 'y' is the column that we are attempting to predict. \n",
    "\n",
    "| Variable | Description   |\n",
    "|------|------|\n",
    "| age | numerical value of call recipients age |\n",
    "| job | type of job |\n",
    "| marital | individuals marital status |\n",
    "| education | type of education |\n",
    "| default | has a credit in default? yes or no |\n",
    "| housing | has a housing loan? |\n",
    "| loan | has a personal loan? |\n",
    "| contact | contact communication type: cellular or telephone |\n",
    "| month | last contact month |\n",
    "| day_of_week | day of the week contacted |\n",
    "| duration | last contact duration in seconds |\n",
    "| campaign | number of contacts performed durint this campaign and for client |\n",
    "| pdays |number of days passed from last contact |\n",
    "| previous | number of contacts performed before this client |\n",
    "| poutcome | outcome of previous campaign |\n",
    "| emp.var.rate | employment variation rate |\n",
    "| cons.price.idx | consumer price index |\n",
    "| cons.conf.idx | consumer confidence index |\n",
    "| euribor3m | euribor 3 month rate |\n",
    "| nr.employed | number of employees |\n",
    "| y | The variable we are trying to predict, whether or not a client has subscribed a term deposit ('yes', 'no') |\n",
    " \n",
    "In the real world, this data would be used to determine which demographics to target in order to get the best response. Because making the call is a very easy task and has very little risk and no concequences when the caller does not sign up for a deposit, we will only consider true positives in our data set. These are the values that would help marketers determine who to target. The more data we recieve the better we would be able to predict. "
